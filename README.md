## Algorithm practice space

Contain solutions that I have worked on to solve algorithm problems from different sources online. 
The language for all codes is Python. Each `.py` file should include should explain with problem statement and task to solve.
The separate file in the master branch does not include test case data. However, in each folder, there is `.py` solution and test data that I used.
